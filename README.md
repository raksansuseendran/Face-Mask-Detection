Synopsis:
----------

• Built an image classification algorithm which classifies images having faces with and without mask.

• Created a model that detects face mask trained on 1775 images with 3 color channels (RGB).

• On Custom CNN architecture Model training accuracy reached 94%.


Implementation steps:
----------------------

• Installing Dependencies

• Importing Datasets

• Data preprocessing

• Data Normalization

• Train-test splitting

• Classification - CNN
